# Starter Kit
###### by Jessica Felts

Use this blank project to kickstart your next website!

### What's New?

This Starter Kit now includes the option for a Desktop-First styling approach, as well as the original Mobile-First styling approach. These have been broken down into individual folders for easier access by potential users.

### Includes:

**index.html** file
+ meta information
+ blank title
+ link to normalize.css cdn
+ link to main.css file

**main.css** file
+ global styles to make your life easier
+ main-container styling to get you started
+ a mobile-first media query setup

### Media Queries:

#### Mobile-First Styling

Mobile-first optimized media queries allow for 9 breakpoints, and one additional query for screens smaller than the first breakpoint. Developers will not need to use _every_ breakpoint for _every_ project, but these have been provided to give the Developer a better understanding of popular screen sizes. _(The sizes have been determined with help from Chrome Developer Tools and general knowledge of popular Monitor Resolutions)_

+ < 320px -- _Mobile XS_
+ 320px -- _Mobile S_
+ 375px -- _Mobile M_
+ 425px -- _Mobile L_
+ 768px -- _Mobile XL / Tablet_
+ 1024px -- _Tablet / Laptop / Desktop XS_
+ 1280px -- _Desktop S_
+ 1366px -- _Desktop M_
+ 1440px -- _Desktop L_
+ 1920px -- _Desktop XL_

#### Desktop-First Styling

Desktop-first optimized media queries allow for 9 breakpoints, and an additional query for screens larger than the first breakpoint. Developers will not need to use _every_ breakpoint for _every_ project, but these have been provided to give the Developer a better understanding of popular screen sizes. _(The sizes have been determined with help from Chrome Developer Tools and general knowledge of popular Monitor Resolutions)_

+ >= 1920px -- Desktop XL
+ 1919px -- Desktop L
+ 1439px -- Desktop M
+ 1365px -- Desktop S
+ 1279px -- Tablet / Laptop / Desktop XS
+ 1023px -- Mobile XL / Tablet
+ 767px -- Mobile L
+ 424px -- Mobile M
+ 374px -- Mobile S
+ 319px -- Mobile XS

### Please Note:

If you are also planning to use the Bootstrap CSS framework, it supports the following breakpoints automatically:

+ >= 1200px -- Large Devices, Desktops
+ >= 992px -- Medium Devices, Desktops
+ >= 768px -- Small Devices, Tablets
+ < 767px -- Extra Small Devices, Phones

This Starter Kit can be used in combination with the Bootstrap framework breakpoints, for a more customized development experience.
